# π
My answer to the task: you’re given a random number generator and your task is to estimate the number pi.
I was given this challenge by a friend, who learnt that I had started learning to code.
I was given no further context. Simply that the approximation must use a random number generator.
# Evaluation
I feel that the solution is a bit cheating, because it uses a radians to degrees convertor.
It also is not in the spirit of using the random number generator that one sees with the Monte Carlo solution
I also have been unable to understand why reducing the size of the angle doesn't creater a closer approximation of π. 
I looked into whether there was an issue in python in dealing with very small numbers, or large decimals, but using a package that better deals with such didn't produce an improvement.
I would love feedback on this, from anyone who could explain why the approximation doesn't improve, or suggest a superior yet similar geometric approach.
